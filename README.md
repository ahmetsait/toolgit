Downloads
---------
### [Tarball (Posix)](https://github.com/ahmetsait/toolgit/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz)

Installing
----------
Extract ToolGit to an appropriate folder of your choice and add the folder path to your `PATH` environment variable. Git will recognize executable `git-*` files in `PATH` and allow using them as sub-commands.

Execute the line below to install aliases as well:
```sh
git config set --append --global include.path path/to/toolgit/aliases.ini
```

Getting Started
---------------
Use `-?` switch to learn about commands and their options. Example:
```
$ git mode-restore -?
usage: git-mode-restore [-s <tree-ish>] [-W] [-S] [-8] [-n] [-q] [-?] path [path ...]

Restore file modes in index and/or worktree.

positional arguments:
  path

options:
  -s <tree-ish>, --source <tree-ish>
                        Restore file modes from the given tree. If not specified, the modes are restored from HEAD if --staged is given, otherwise from the index.
  -W, --worktree        The working tree modes are restored. This is the default.
  -S, --staged          File modes in the index are restored. Specifying both --worktree and --staged restores both index and worktree.
  -8, --octal           Print permissions in octal based numeric format instead of using 'rwx' letters.
  -n, --dry-run         Donâ€™t actually restore file modes, just show what would happen.
  -q, --quiet           Suppress printing file permission changes to standard output.
  -?, --help            Show this help text and exit.
```
Example `mode-restore` usage:
```
$ git status
